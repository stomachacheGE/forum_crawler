      "\n",
      "A small Canadian company has waded into a U.S. drug price controversy by offering to make an expensive prostate cancer drug for a fraction of the price.Right now Xtandi costs U.S. patients as much as $129,000 US a year, or about $90 per pill. St. Catharines, Ont.-based Biolyse Pharma says it can make the drug for $3 a pill, or $4,400 per year, but has so far been unable to get U.S. health authorities to override the existing patent.Biolyse Pharma initially made the offer to make a cheaper version of Xtandi (enzalutamide) to the U.S. government in April. The issue resurfaced last week after pharmaceutical giant Pfizer announced it will pay $14 billion US to buy Medivation, the makers of the drug, primarily on the strength of Xtandi. Medivation, along with Astellas Pharma Inc.of Japan, which owns the drug rights outside the U.S., licensed the patents for Xtandi from the University of California, Los Angeles, where the drug was discovered. Much of the early research and development was publicly funded, and that means U.S. federal agencies have a legal right to override the patents under certain circumstances. Used by a minority of prostate cancer patients \n",

He was at Navy Pier on VJ day and experienced the VJ day celebrations in the Loop.  After a brief tour of duty, he was discharged in time to enroll at Northwestern for the class of 1950.  \n",

      "He majored in Organic Chemistry, received a Masters at Northwestern, met my mother, was married in 1952, and went on to receive his PhD at what was then Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh.

      "When PC hit in the early 90's (sorry, I don't remember which year, I think it was 1991, when he turned 65), PSA was just coming into common use.  Again, I don't have the details.  What I do know is that following his diagnosis, he applied his research mind, and chose to participate in the early use of whole-gland cryotherapy project at Cleveland Clinic.  I recall from what he told me then, that he did it because of the opportunity to do something cutting edge, rather than submit to open surgery--which, as I recall, was still primarily the trans-perineal method.\n",

      "In about 2000, his PSA started back, and he went on HT.  I think, again, at the time it was before Lupron, so he was on synthetic estrogen, one shot a month.  That lasted a couple of years, then they found cancer growing on his Ureters.  He had radiation treatments on that, finishing in the spring of 2004.  Early that summer he took a fall and it appeared that he injured his tailbone.  He had gradually worsening back pain all that summer, and in August that year he was found to have spinal mets.  As I said at the heading, he passed in October that year.\n",

      "When I look at his battle, I keep coming back to the reality that he chose the path he took, at least in part, because of the research angle.  He wanted to be a pathfinder, a test subject.

      "Hello to all, 5 July 2016 was my 30 month post op anniversary.  Still less than 0.04 psa as it was at 4 weeks post Da Vinci.  Thank you to all for the support.  Leaking still, not much, but bothersome now.  I will be undertaking urodynamics on 24 August and I'm really leaning towards the bladder bulking procedure instead of the advance sling.  Any suggestions?  I leak about a shot glass a day, some positions make me vulnerable, and sex, forget it.  If I even then about arousal, I start spitting like I'm chewing Red Man again!!!  Erections are about 90 % with and without Cialis, so I stopped altogether.\n",

      "Purgatory has reported in a concurrent thread that the physician overseeing his treatment for the past five years has left, apparently under unclear circumstances as to why, leaving David having to scramble now to find a new doctor.\n",
      "\n",
      "While perhaps most of us have never faced this unexpected and likely unpleasant situation, and hopefully never will (although there may have been occasions when it was we who left the physician), it's obviously going to be a troublesome matter. Especially if it happens out of the blue, as it apparently has for David.\n",

      "The article below is by a physician on this subject. \n",
      "\n",
      "At first the author laments that many of the circumstances of practicing modern medicine have made it so difficult for some physicians, that leaving medicine altogether has become an option for them. That leaves their patients to find new providers, usually rather quickly, and which, the author reports, is becoming more and more difficult to do in many areas. (\"Areas\" in both senses of the word, both geographical and clinical specialty).\n",
      "\n",
      "He then mentions the emotional impact that this can have on some patients, especially if they have been with the physician for a long time and prefer that person, and the news that he or she is leaving has been abrupt and unexpected.\n",
      "\n",
      "He then discusses how insurance issues can hamper the patient's search for a new provider, that it's not as simple a thing as finding a new doctor one likes, but that the patient's insurance has to go along with this choice, and not impose restrictions. (The author's advice: as soon as you learn that your physician is leaving, contact your insurance carrier immediately to begin the process of finding a new provider acceptable to your carrier).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ideally, a physician will announce departure or termination of practice with enough lead time to allow patients to find other resources. \n",

      "I'm wondering if your wife might be in denial.  We all go thru these steps when faced with life threatening illness.  I know Charlie accepted his diagnosis much sooner than I did and I'm sure I wasn't as supportive or empathetic as I should have been.  It is difficult when you look good and are still functioning well and then we don't want you to be sick so we can tell ourselves you are not sick and block it out easier than you can.  As Charlie's disease has progressed I realized that I had been in denial longer than he was and I feel sad.  I am now more attuned to his feelings, symptoms and pain.  Communication is key, difficult to do but it is a necessity. Don't be fearful of asking for what you need or want-she will only be able to provide if you tell her.  Does your wife go with you to your dr appointments?  It might help her get more in tuned to what's happening.  I don't feel our family-esp Charlie's parents and sisters are very supportive but thru counseling I have learned to accept how \"it is\" and forget about how I think \"it should be\"! Good luck and prayers for you and your family.Post Edited (Nell79) : 7/12/2016 6:03:43 PM (GMT-6) \n",
